## This is your RLRA Agent to help you!

To start, follow the steps to setup Ollama. 
Then to setup the base and start asking questions:

'''
python run.py
'''

Tell the agent to what you are looking for by giving the title or content. 
Then tell the type of other information, you are looking for :
1 - Code 
2 - Method 
3 - Results 
4 - Methodlogy


### Setup OLLAMA

### Current Knowledge Base include the following papers :

1. Foundation Policies with Hilbert Representations
2. Reinforcement Learning from Passive Data via Latent Intentions
3. Offline Reinforcement Learning with Implicit Q-Learning
4. Does Zero-Shot Reinforcement Learning Exist?
5. Reinforcement Learning with Prototypical Representations
